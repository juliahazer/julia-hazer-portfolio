# Julia Hazer Portfolio Site 

### A responsive single page application that gives information about me, my skills, my projects, a contact form (with validation), and links to my external sites. 

#### Features Include:
* When nav bar links are clicked, smooth page scrolling to anchor sections using animation effects.

* Active nav bar links are automatically updated when a user scrolls through the page.
* The skills icons (which have been customized using SVG) are responsive.
* An interactive portfolio, using modals to display additional info when a user clicks a project.
* A user can submit a contact form, which is checked using validation, and when complete, is emailed to me using PHP (NOTE: needs an SMTP server, so this will feature will not work on GitHub Pages).
* Site is responsive to different device screen sizes.
